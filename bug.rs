fn main() {    let mut x = 5;    let y = &mut x;    let z = &mut x;    *y = 6;    *z = 7;    println!("x = {}", x);}This code leads to undefined behavior because it creates multiple mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x` without proper synchronization mechanisms.  The compiler cannot guarantee which write operation (*y = 6 or *z = 7) will take effect, leading to unpredictable results.
